# Play Ping Pong game with your friends by using Python.

Ping Pong is a game in which two players hit a ball back and forth across a table using a small paddle. A point is scored for the player when the another player fails to return the ball. The winner is the one who gets more points than the another.

As you can see in the video, you must control the left paddle by using "W" and "S", and the right paddle by using "O" and "L".



**Note:** You must install "freegames" library in order to run the game, and you can install the library as follows:
